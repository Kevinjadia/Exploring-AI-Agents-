Subject: Project Phoenix Update and Next Steps

Hi team,

I wanted to follow up on yesterday's discussion about Project Phoenix and outline our next steps.

Key points from our discussion:
- The beta testing phase has shown promising results with 85% positive feedback
- We're still facing some performance issues on mobile devices
- The client has requested additional features for the dashboard

Let's schedule a follow-up meeting this Friday, June 15th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. The meeting should last about 1.5 hours, and we'll need to prepare the updated project timeline.

Action items:
1. Sarah to address the mobile performance issues by June 20th (High priority)
2. Miguel to create mock-ups for the new dashboard features by next Monday
3. Everyone to review the beta testing feedback document and add comments by EOD tomorrow

If you have any questions before Friday's meeting, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
Alex Johnson
Senior Project Manager
